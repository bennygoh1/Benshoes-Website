# Benshoes-Website
This is a project that requires me to develop a website in under a week using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a framework called Bootstrap.

# More description
1. I made this website for my school website, that requires the use of extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap to develop a E-commerence website with a shopping cart system.
2. I made this website in under a week, so please do not take this too seriously as this may contain some broken functionality in certain parts.
3. The shopping cart system is broken, you can add products to the cart but you cannot remove the products, that is the downside that i was not able to fix in such a short period of time.
4. In the future, I might update this website and fix some functionalities whenever I am free.
5. As I am still learning those programming languages and frameworks, do not expect it to run very smoothly. I had a anuerysm trying to write code in JS. Trust me it is not fun.

#Programming languages and Frameworks used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap

#More background clarity
I made this website alone for this school project, as someone who is new to front end development, developing a website like this without any help is hard.

#Preview
Images and other demonstrations coming soon.
